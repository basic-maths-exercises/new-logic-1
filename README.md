# Calculating the modulus

Lets start these exercises by applying the ideas covered in the video.  In the video, you were shown how we can calculate set the variable `fx` equal to the modulus of a variable called `x` by using a function like the one below:

````
x = -3
if x<0 :
   fx = -1*x
else :
   fx = x

print( fx )
````

To complete this exercise you need to use code similar to the one above to set the variables `fx`, `fy` and `fz` equal to the moduli of `x`, `y` and `z` respectively.
